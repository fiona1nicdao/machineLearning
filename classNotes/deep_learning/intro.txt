lecture 1: introduction 

Imagenet 
    22k categories and 14 million images 
    22k different classifiers 
    animals / plants / structures /preson / etc ...

image classification challenge : 1000 objects classes 

graph is the error 
    2010 the error is 28.2 
    2012 used neural networks used and error rate went down 
    2015 the image classificatio challenge basically solved smallest amount of error 

Convolution neural networks (CNN) have become an important tool for object recognition

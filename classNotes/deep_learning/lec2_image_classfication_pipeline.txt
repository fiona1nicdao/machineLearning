lecture 2: image classficiation pipline 

image classficiation : a core task in computer vision .. 

the problem : semantic gap
    what the computer sees 
    an image is just a bog grid of numbers between [0,255]
    a pixal by pixal image - is what the computer sees 
    ex: 800 x 600 x 3 (3 channels RGB) 
        RGB = red, green, blue which is a number 0 - 255 

an image classifier 
    ... 
attempts have been made 
    find edges , find corners 

data-driven approach 
    1. collect a dataset of images and labels 
    2. use machine learning to train a classfier 
    3. evaluate the classifier on new images 

First classifier : nearest neighbor 
    memorize all data and labels 
    predict ... 

Example dataset: CIFAR10 
    won't work 
 skip a lot of slides 

linear classfication 

neural networks is multiple linear classifiers 

Parametric approach / linear classeifier

matrix (3 x 4)
first number is the number of rows 
second number is the number of columns 
ex: 3 rows and 4 columns 

[ 3, 4]  * [4 X 1] = [3, 1]

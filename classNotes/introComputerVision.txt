CNN : compu

computer images 
    3 color channels 
    height: 4 units (pixels)
    width: 4 units (pixels)

Mnist dataset 
    hello world of deep learning 
    classify 28x28 pixels grayscale images of handwritten digits 

Load MNIST dataset 

Prepare trianing data

Network architecture 
    10 classes 
    so 10 outputs for all 10 claases 

complilation and training 
    compile to get data structure 
    specify the loss you want to use 
    the fit method to wheere you pass the training data 
    when you are trianing the data you are keeping an eye on the loss bc you can the loss to decrease after each epoch 

Making predictions 
    predictions 
Evaluate on never-before-seen digits

    CV led to the ..

CNN is a stack of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D
    inputs = keras.input 
    conv2D is a sequence of layers and passes its output to the next layer 
    CNN is a Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers of these two 
    7 layers in this example 
Problem with MLP: its not translation invariant ! 
    training : picture of cat near right side 
    test : picture car near left side 
    MLP will fail if the cat is not exactly in the right position 

The convolution operation 
    look at image and look at the features within the image 
    -fundamental difference between a densely connected layer and convolution 

Lines and textures to simple objects to cat 
    - cat : look at features and then decide what to classify 

This is not a without problems 
    picture of features = face (test)
    picture of face = face (training )
    presents of the features not the distance of the features 

convolution with a 3x 3 filter (no depth)
    dot product : filter and image patch  = feature 
    focus on one feature (we have no idea what that feature is )
    each filter capture one feature 
    you choose the number of filters (hyper-parameter )

    filter is to detect one kind of feature 
    output maxtrix  = feature map : this map of input image and tells you if that feature you are looking for is in that section of the image 

CNN applied to image classification 
    early layers are simple feature (lines or shapes)
    later layers create higher level features / combine lower level features to more complex objects (eyes, nose, ears )

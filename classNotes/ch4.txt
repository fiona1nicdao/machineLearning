Chapter 4 : data preprocessing : practical issues 
L1 regulation important !!!
Splitting data into train and test
    download the win dataset 
    similar to homework 
    clear that you can't use the training data for test data 
    you want unbias data 
    so allocate some portion for testing and use the rest for traing 
        70% testing and 305 for testing 
    N-fold cross-validation : will look at chapter 6 
Wine datast 
    table of the features of the wine 
feature scaling 
    have features with different ranges 
    how to fix : normalization or standarization 
Normalization 
    normalization refers to the rescalling for the features to a range of [0,1]
Standartization 
    the procedure of standardization can be expressed by the following equation 
L1 regulation 
    L2 - to limit overfitting 
    L2 regulation - one approach to reduct model complexity / L2 making sure that one of the weights don't overpower the other weights because it is overfitting and not generalizing / also minimizing the weights / is the sum of the w^2 
    L1 is sum of the weights is aboluate values 
    L1 is very different from effect from L2
L1 regularization 
    L1 yields sparse solutions look at example 1 and example 2
    vectors is a series of numbers 
EXAMPLE 1
    model with weights w = [0.1,0.9]
    features x = [10,12]
    so the 2nd feature is more important than the 1st feature 
EXAMPLE 2
    model with weights w = [0.1,0.9,-0.17, 0. 19, ... 0.5]
    how do you understand when there are a lot of weights 
    how do you interpret the model know 
    so a model with weights that are 50 are not easy to interpretate 
EXAMPLE 3 
    model is easy to understand when most of the features are zero and only a few weights / features matter 
L2 regularization 
    graph / mathemetical explanation 
    penalty term 
    cost penalty
    the compromise is the middle point of minimize cost + penalty 
L1 regularization 
    easier to find bc absolute value graph 

Why would be use L1 vs L2 ? learn in chapter 6
    L1 - want if zero weights / less weights 
    L2 - 

LOOK AT python code for chapter 4

comp 474 : Machine Learning 
huggingphase.co ? deep learning 
chapter 1 ML intro 
- AI building computers that act like humans 
-machine learning is a way to do  build AI 
math to learn 
-math: partial derivatives , matrix and vector operations , 
-      basic probablity and statistics : conditional probablity and normal distribution 
matrix is table (arrays 2d)
 
 Programming: python, numpy, matplotlib 
 - numPy library will help with matrix 
 - matplotlib library will help with plots 

machine learning - wiki 
- explores that study and construction of algorithms that can learn form and make prediction on data 

applications: image recongnition, spam classification , web search engines, voice, recongnition, line to quora
 - large language models, generative AI, deep fakes, alpha folds
 - web search engines : rank the webpages of the "best" website on the top 
 - 

machine learning: processing LARGE data 

three types of ML 
- supervised learning - learning by examples (80% of the course)
- unsupervised learning - give you data and find the patterns (told nothing)
- reinforcement learnign -  more important today - ppl use large models (generative AI)
                different from supervised learning by ... soccer and chess 
                review recongnition learning 

MLP class for the spring - large language models 
Yann LeCun explains supervisedlearning (con-nets)
- a pattern  recongnition system is like a block box ith a cammeria at one end , and a green light and a red light on topm and a while bunch of knobs on the front 
the learning algorithm tried to adjust the nobs so that whe msay a dog is in front of the cameria, the red light turns on and when a cari is put in front of the camera, 
the green light turns on . Yuo show a dog to the machine. if the red light is bright, don't do anything . if its dim , tweak the knobs so that the light get brighter 

what is a model ? a function ... what is a function ? a set of steps that you put an input and get an output 

scaling up 
- IEEE Spectrum interview / deep leaning system 
- gradients computing 

Supervised learning 
- predicting the future with supervised learning (predicitng the future with NEW data )
- classification vs regression 
    classification - finite: SPAM or NOT SPAM (finite number of labels )
    regression - infinite: continuous number of labels / gradient (the price - is a scale)
training data: examples of cat and dog 
labels (classes) = cats and dogs 

classification 
- predicts categorical class labels based on past observation 
- class labels are discrte unordered values
- email spam classification example (binary) - two options: yes or now/ 1 or 0 / + or - 
- handwritten digit classification example (multi-class): like scanning a document / deposit the check / image to text 

regression 
- continuous outcomes 

unsupervised learning 
- dealing with unlabeled dat 
- cluster analysis
- objects within a cluster share a degree of similarity 
- examples: latent dirichlet allocation (popular machine learning) LDA , Sara Palin topics 

Iris dataset : why matrix are important 
- samples: instances, observations : the rows are the instances 
    each row is a vector: list of values / list of numbers / bunch of numbers 
    a stack of rows (vectors) is a matrix 
    matrix in the 4D can find a way to get a line to separate 
- class labels: targets : are the last column 
- features: attributes, measuresments, dimensions : columns are the features 
     features can be numbers, characters, enum
     non-number features will need to calculated to numbers / map to numbers 
     titanic dataset 

Basic term
- sample x features matrix ex: 150 samples of flowers x 4 features 
- how to extract these features ? hard to get these measuresments
- features that will predict the class target 

Model selection 
- no free lunch theorem: no one algorithmt that will work with all problems 
    any two optimization algorithm are equivalent when their performancis averaged across all possible problems 
- learning algorithms: neural networks 
example:  a toy universe that exist for exactly two days on each day (not good example)

model selection
- whats the intuition behind NFL? 
- each classification algorithm makes assumptions 
- often we empirically determine wha works best 
- but how do we know what works best ? 
    classification accuracy
    train+Dev + Test split 
    hyperparameter optiziation (knobos of the model )

Python of ML 
- library for scientific computing such as NumPy and SciPy
- performance of interpreted languages is inferior
- but numpy and scipy build upon lower level C and fortan subroutines 
-scikit-learn library
